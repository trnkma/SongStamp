# SongStamp

A music relase guessing game

# How to play (Setup)
First of all, a Spotify Premium Account is need to play!

When you launch the app for the first time you will need to connect to your Spotify Account. If the connection was successful you will be redirected to the website and will see some settings options.

Settings:
- Teams: chose the number of teams (at least one team is needed to play the game!)
- Playlists: search Spotify for the Playlists you want to play with. These will form the pool of songs from which the game will chose the songs randomly. (at least one playlist is needed to play the game!)

Confirm the settings and the game will start.

# How to play (Rules)
You can choose the rules for yourself. Set yourself a limit of successfully guessed releases at which a team wins the round.
If you want to start a new round, just reload the page. (not implemented yet, sorry)

## Purpose of the app
Songstamp is a simple game, where players need to order songs by their release date. The app is based on the table top game "Hitster".

Motivation for building Songstamp:

Matthias loves the game Hitster and already after the first time playing it he had a web based version of it in mind. He already started building one in Angular, but this version didn't make it very far. So this project was a good reason to try it again.

## Local dev setup
To run the app locally, you need to change the redirect URI in the AuthService to your local IP-Adress you are hosting the app on.

## Some features still missing
- Currently you can only start a new game by reloading the page. (ugly way)
- no real feedback if guessed right or wrong
- no option to save track to like songs in Spotify
